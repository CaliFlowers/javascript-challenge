# JavaScript Challenge - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Javascript
There is a trifecta of programming languages that are near universally used all over the Internet: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The first two of these manipulate the physical attributes of webpages, i.e. deal with the visible structure of pages on the Internet; the third one, Javascript, imbues web pages with dynamism by making them interactive with user actions. Javascript acts as a "man behind the curtain" in that it is largely unseenwhile responsible for many of the user-side aspects of the online experience. For one, Javascript events are responsible for making websites responsive to user actions ranging from resizing resizing pages to fit different screen sizes to responding to user actions as simple as clicking a button. 

## Data Analysis in Javascript
Generally speaking, Javascript doesn't have much to offer the typical data analyst, unlike Python with the functionality of the Pandas library. In Python, Pandas handles the presentation and organization of data, as well as most of the manipulations that can be performed on the data. Javascript has no exact analogue to a Pandas dataframe; but this project demonstrates how a Bootstrap table and Javascript data functions compensate for this. Javascript has multiple built-in functions: map functions extract object entries, perform manipulatios to each targeted entry, then return a new array. the For Eavh function specifies an lternative way to write functions in Javasscript. filter functions set selection criteria for winnowing a dataset.  

## DOM Manipulation
Javascript is an Object-Oriented Programming Language (OOPL). Like Python, it allows for the assignment of key-value pairs to specific objects. Simlarly, Javascript allows for the selection of HTML elements; and targetting them for mamipulation. Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulationis the blanket term referring to the manipulation of objects in Javascript. An object containng key-value pairs can be manipulated to create, update, or destroy information values contained on these objects.  DOM Manipulation is analogous to CRUD operations in SQL and Python. 
Without Pandas dataframes, the most common container for data in Javascipt is an array of objects containing key-value pairs. For this project, a bootstrap table is substituted for a Pandas dataframe. 

## Web Interactivity
While DOM may appear severely limited in terms of what functionalities it can offer to the Data Analyst., Javascript's front-end orientation allows the Analyst to directly hand the user the ability to mnipulate data in the manner of their liking. . In this project, that comes in the form of giving the user the ability to set theor own criteria for filtering the data.  

##UFO Finder. 
This project is intended to demonstrateseveral features of Javascript. 
The dataset icontains data from over a hundred UFO reports ariund the world.
