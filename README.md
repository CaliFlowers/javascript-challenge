# Javascript-challenge

## Javascript

Javascript is the third member of a trifecta of programming languages that predominate the Internet. HTML makes up the physical architecture of web pages; CSS provides styling to webpages; and Javascript makes webpages interactive. Aside from that short summary, Javascript also has functionalities that can be valuable additions to a data analyst's portfolio of skills: it has list comprehensions in the form of arrays, it can pass data entries in the form of object-oriented programming, and it has in-built functions that facilitate the handling and filtering of data.  

## Data Analysis in Javascript

Javascript is a good language for data analysis. While it doesn't yet match Python in terms of dictionaries dedicated to facilitating Data Science, it possesses enough functionality to pass data to the Iternet and put this data at the finger tips of ordinary people o the Internet.  Interactive webpages allow users to be their own storytellers; to perform their own analyses; and to draw their own conclusions. This is ncredibly useful for data analysts who want to present their work in a manner that is accessible to the public. 

## Javascript Data Functions

Like Python, Javascript has in built functions that are useful for data analysts. Javascript arrays function much like lists in Python; and are similarly ammenable to manipulation. As Javascript does not have the functionality offered by Python's Pandas ibrary, one has to rely on in-built functions like .flter and .map to manipulate data in Javascript. .filter allows an analyst to select objects from an array that meet specified criteria. .map is a function that allows objects in an array to be manipulated then pushed to a new array. Alternatively, a programmer can program their own functions to manipulate data in javascript as demonstrated in this project. 

## Interactive Data in Webpages

One of the more obvious features of this project is the table of daa on UFO Sightings. This table is interactive in the sense that the user is able to filter the data with criteria they specify. This is made possible by connecting the HTML skeleton of the webpage to an array of data in Javascript; and the interactive properties of Javascript Events that make HTML objects responsive to user actions. Despite the absence of a dataframe to organize data, Javascript can use html features like tables to dispay data. In lieu of Pandas functions, a data analyst can use filter functions to sift through this data. In addition, the data analyst can hand the power of these functionalities to a front-end user by designing a webpage that places these functionalities at the user's fingertips.
